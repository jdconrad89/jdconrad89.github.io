                <br><br><br>
                <p> Briefcase is an index of Turing alumni for employers to see. Students can create portfolios which detail
                    the students' background and preferences. They are also able to link projects they worked on throughout
                    their time at Turing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Users login through Census, a third party authorization application created by Turing students. All pictures and files are hosted on AWS S3.
                    Briefcase runs on a Rails backend, with the frontend being done in React, and the database with Postgres.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On this project I was tasked with giving the graduates the ability to enter their previous experiences so that
                    potential employers would be able to search for graduates with experience in particular fields. I also implemented
                    the search funtionality for people to find alumni by their previous experience.

                <h3> The Count </h3>

                <img src="img/the_count.jpg" alt="a picture of the homepage of the count" style="width:750px;border:0">
                <br><br><br>
                <p>
                    The Count was a personal project that I worked on during my third module of Turing. Over the past few years I have tried many different
                    diets and have found that for the most part all of these diet companies held the power and control.
                    If you wanted to lose weight you had to pay their membership fees, buy their food, utilize their recipes
                    etc. I constanly was finding that there really wasn't a way to find out the nutritional information for
                    my own recipes. With The Count you have the ability to look up the nutritional information for a single
                    item (either an item you can buy at a grocery store or at a restaurant). You are also able to look up
                    create recipe cards and add ingredients to it so you can track the nutritional information of your favorite
                    recipes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Being a personal project I personally built every aspect of The Count. It's ran on a Rails backend, utilizes a Postgres database,
                    authorization is completed with Facebook oauth, and it uses the Nutritionix api to find the nurtirional information.
                    Eventually I want to make The Count a one stop shop for living a healthier life, adding calorie burning tracking,
                    nutritional blogs, and boards for people to share recipes and support during their journey to a healthier life.

                <h3> Mini Market </h3>

                <p>
                  Mini Market was a group project in which myself and three other people created an online market. With Mini Market you can create a user account,
                  look at items by category, select items to add to your cart, adjust the amount of a particular item in your cart, complete an order, and view your past orders
                </p>

                <p>
                    I really tried to spread myself around on this project and have experience in many aspects of the project as I could.
                    I helped with the authentication process, authorization process, I built the cart, and helped with some basic styling
                    amongst helping others with other aspects of the project.
