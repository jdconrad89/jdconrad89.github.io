            <p>Hello all! My name is Jason Conrad. I am currently a student at Turing School of Software and Design.</p>
            <p>I started this journey a few months ago and I can already tell that my life will never be the same.
              Before my time at Turing I worked in the retail industry for about 6 years. While I enjoyed what it was that I
              was doing I realized that retail was not where I wanted to be for the rest of my life. After much self reflection
              and research I decided to persue Software Design. That decision brought me here to Turing, a decision that will
              forever change my life.</p>
            <p>A little personal information about myself. My hobbies include playing guitar (or anything that has to do with
               music for that matter), cooking, anything sports related, and as of recently coding.</p>
