          <h2>Module 1</h2>
            Module 1.
            <p>I’ve never been one to sit down and write out my thoughts or feelings so a blog is a new venture to me
               so here goes nothing:
            </p>

            <p>I made the decision to repeat module one and looking at my first time around and when I completed
               Mod 1: The Sequel (as I came to affectionately call it) I can honestly say it was the best decision
               that I could have made.
            </p>

            <p>The first time around I struggled to really understand what was going on enough to be able to ask
               questions in regards to what it was that I didn’t know, which definitely took some getting used to.
               By the end I felt I had a decent understanding of what it was that my programs were doing and how they
               were doing it. That being said t i was struggling with how to break things down and how to create solid
               testing for what I was creating.
            </p>

            <p>When it boiled down to it the decision to repeat was one of the easiest and yet one of the most
               difficult decisions I’ve had to make in quite sometime. Admitting that you are not where you want to be
               and that you could use more time and help can be very overwhelming.
            </p>

            <p>Mod 1 the sequel overall was a much more enjoyable experience, the difference in my ability to grasp
               the information was like night and day. My overall comfort with the information allowed me to help my
               fellow classmates more (which in turn reenforced my knowledge) and be far more involved in the community.
            </p>

            <p>By far my favorite technical concept is the one that I struggled with the most: TDD. TDD (or Test Driven
               Development) was by far my achilles heel through all of my first go-around with mod 1 and part of my second
               time. I understood the importance of it and how it was there to help us but I struggled with what it was that
               should be tested and how it should be tested. The simple answer to that first question is EVERYTHING should be
               tested. One day I was looking on Youtube for videos on TDD and I came across this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhwElTL-mdI&t=1082s">gem</a>.
               It really put a lot in perspective for me in regards to TDD and set me on the path towards success.
            </p>

            <p>I look forward to taking the things I have learned and the techniques I have acquired into Mod 2 as I
               continue this journey called Turing.
